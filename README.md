This is (eventually) going to be a discord bot that does the following:
- Integrates with a user's Github and Visual Studio Code Microsoft Live Share Extension
- Automatically posts the user's Liveshare link to the target server. Asks first since it's not rude
- Lets you choose which server(s) you'd like to post join links to.

When it's all said and done, the bot should make it easy to join Live Share sessions with your teammates!
